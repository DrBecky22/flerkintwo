            <p>Hi - I'm Dr. Becky Andrews and this is the demo page for my "leaning to code" journey.  
            Yeah, I know, learning to code in your 50's - in 2025 when coding jobs are going away - insanity... It has been said, it has been noted... Sometimes you just have to follow your passion.  I am enjoying learning to code every bit as much as I enjoy studying medicine.  They are surprisingly similar.  I began my self-guided 'learn to code' adventure in March 2022 with my eye on self-building resources needed by my community and patient base. Being a holistic thinker, that has lead me down a long winding path to understand how it all works together. I've completed several self-paced bootcamps, and one "real time" bootcamp that was not very helpful. There has been much eye-rolling from various teachers when I want to take 6 month detours to learn how something really works, but I stick by my process and after 3 years it is finally yeilding results.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="pb-4">
              I do owe a big shout out to:
            </p>
            <ol class="list-disc ml-8 space-y-3 text-gray-800">
              <li>My brother - the networking, server, security and history guru - Mike Andrews of <a class="text-blue-600 underline hover:text-blue-800" href="www.fark.com">fark.com</a> - yes, THAT Mike Andrews</li>
              <li>My "pulling it all together" tutor Miguel Ludert </li>
              <li>Colt Steele's Fullstack Bootcamp on Udemy - his amazing teaching really helped make sense of it all</li>
              <li>Dr. Angela Yu and her Fullstack Bootcamp on Udemy - I didn't finish that camp, but having a British physician teach me basic coding was the spark that got me to believe that this was even possible</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p class="pb-4">What you are seeing here is 100% hand-coded by me. That includes:
              <ol class="list-disc ml-8 space-y-3 text-gray-800">
                <li>Homepage - simple HTML with responsive Tailwind CSS styling</li>
                <li>CatGallery - simple HTML with Flexbox and responsive Bootstrap styling</li>
                <li>SnuffyGames - static HTML with Bootstrap and Basic Javascript</li>
                <li>ToDo and TacoStand are not yet live, they will be tiny MERN full-stack proof-of-concept projects using React, forms, and a database</li>
                <li>It is being served to you from a hand-build VM Droplet on Digital Ocean</li>
                <li>The server is running Ubuntu, Nginx, MongoDB Community edition, and connecting to Mailgun for updates and error messaging</li>
                <li>Domain is hosted at Cloudflare, making use of their security features, and TLS/SSL certificates</li>
                <li>Code is deployed from GitHub - someday automated with GitHub actions or webhooks</li>
                <li>Yes, I know there are still some style things to fix... keep yer pants on... I'm working on functionality first</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Yeah, it was hard. It has taken over 3 years to learn enough to get what you are seeing in front of you and functional... but this was the lynchpin. Next I will learn to use modern 'serverless' deployment on AWS.  Then... lookout</p>

What you are viewing was all written by me, hosted on a server I built myself.  I defintely feel like little Anakin, the scrappy builder with no money, learning by trial and error (and a little help from my genius brother, a tutor or two and chatGPT)

      <p class="p-4 text-gray-700 flex-1">Yeah, I know, learning something as dense as servers and full-stack development, on your own, in your 50's, when you are already a doctor... Insanity.  Sometimes you just have to give-in to your passions.  I LOVE to learn.  The more complicated the better.  And if there are real-world applications?  OH yeah... sign me up for late nights and months or years disappearing into a fuge state.  Learning to code has brought me as much joy as the study of medicine.</p>
